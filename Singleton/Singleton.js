// The Singleton pattern is a way to make sure there's only one copy of something in a program.it's ensure that only one instance of a class is created and that this instance can be accessed globally. It's like having a special key to a room that only allows one person inside at a time. This pattern is useful when we want to control access to a shared resource, like a database or a file, so that everyone uses the same copy and doesn't create conflicts.
